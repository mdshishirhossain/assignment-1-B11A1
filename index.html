                <p class="speech-text info-color">"What we need is climate justice – so that the irresponsible choices or, indifferent actions or, harms caused are accounted for. Long-term damages leave irreparable damages all-around: we are losing bio-diversity; changing pathogens leading to newer diseases; farming is under stress; shrinking water wealth threatening habitat; rising sea level and salinity decimating eco-systems. The damages in terms of rising intensity and frequency of cyclones or floods can hardly be ignored. The climatic risks are faced far deeper by our small farmers and artisanal livelihood-holders. As I speak, over five million people witnessed a most devastating flood in their living memory, in eastern Bangladesh."</p>
